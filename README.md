Personal blog, will write things I like: work, life, technologies, etc.

Completely forgot the dependencies of the site, had to have a friend reminding me to on how to install, I'd better start to doc everything toady, it has been a good lesson. The site was written with Jekyll with a template.

    ruby -v
    gem install bundler
    bundlre
    npm i
    npm i -g gulp-cli
