## Using AMP to build a blog

AMP is Accelerated Mobile Pages, *a open source initiative that embodies the vision that publishers can create mobile optimized content once and have it load instantly everywhere.* 

I read this today, thinking about taking my blog from Jekyll to AMP. Doing this is not because the improved milliseconds loading speed on my site. It's all about the spirit of craftsman. Software engineering is like craftsmanship, there isn't the best way, but always the better way. The intention with perfection makes software better and better.
