## Google AMP

AMP is Accelerated Mobile Pages, *a open source initiative that embodies the vision that publishers can create mobile optimized content once and have it load instantly everywhere.*

Google claims AMP is going to be the next generation of static page builder, one feature worthy mentioning is the "almost instant rendering". This could mean that the pursuit of AMP has been pure and straightforward - rendering speed. As in today, mobile device is taking majority of the web traffic, rendering speed is no longer an optimization in the first place, instead, it's a key factor directly outputs the right technology to use. And the result of it has always been that the user
experience a richer content with a incredible rendering speed.
