### About Mac Gaming

I was going to talk about Apple's new graphic technology - Metal in this post. I decided to change topic of the post when I realized Metal was no longer relevant as a new thing.

So, what is Metal? Metal is Apple's new graphic technology, it was first introduced at WWDC 2014 for iOS.(alright, it's not new, it's been 2 years, that is actually why I changed the topic).
