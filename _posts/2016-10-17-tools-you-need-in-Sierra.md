In my previous blog <a href="{{site.url}}/what-I-learned-from-upgrading-my-os">What I learned from upgrading to Sierra</a>. I pointed out one of the professional characteristics that I have lacked for a long time -- problem-solving in a subjective way. In this blog, I am going to explain how I moved on to Sierra. Additionally, I will introduce some excellent tools.

As you know, I am a big fan of using keybindings to boost my productivity. It's hard to set everything up, but I like doing it. In El Captian, I used a bunch of different tools to make my cumbersome workflow just under my fingertips. I am OCD with my tools, and they have to be the ways I like. Otherwise, I won't work until I tweak them to. There are pros and cons of being stubborn. But, as a developer, being stubborn is always on the right side. Life is much more rewarding when using something others don't know how, isn't it?

## Karabiner

Karabiner isn't working correctly in macOS 10.12 Sierra. Regarding the creator, @tekezo, of Karabiner. Apple changed generic keyboard and mouse drivers on Sierra that made an impact to Karabiner, which caused the ineffectiveness. Therefore, Karabiner needs to be re-structured, @tekzo can't give an estimate now.

## Karabiner-Elements

At the same time, @tekezo introduced Karabiner-Elements, a much simpler versioned Karabiner(UI below), that is compatible on Sierra. I downloaded it and tried it. It lacked tons features. I didn't think it was enough to do what I needed. So I moved on.

## BetterTouchTool

I used BTT a long time ago. I downloaded it initially for the sweet window snapping feature. Then I found out there were all sorts of options. So I mapped `hjkl` as `arrow` keys liked the image showing below. I then stopped using it because it lacked key repeat feature. But, now I don't seem to have other options. Okay, let's give a try. So, I set it up and sent the Author an email hoping there might be a way to tweak the key repeat. Meanwhile, I kept looking for other better options. Why?Because being proactive might turn things around.

## Keyboard Maestro

The best always comes last, right? All I needed was patience and persistence. I found Keyboard Maestro from somebody's comment on Karabiner's Issue board. I downloaded and tried it. The UI was intuitive to use and there were tons options I could manipulate with. More importantly, it had `key-down` options meant key repeat is available!

## Conclusion

Somebody once said *Tools are ultimate procrastination*. However to others, tools are motivation.
