I recently gave a short talk to few iOS development students who are currently in Code Camp busting their asses to finish projects. I am very proud of them. Decisions were not easy to make when they wanted to change careers, especially when some of them have families. Most students ditched their no-future careers, then entirely dedicated to intensive Code Camp courses, hopefully, coming out with great skill sets to find jobs that they like.

I heard that a lot of people say coding is easier than it looks, I disagree, coding is not easy at all, in fact, it is hard from lots different aspects. I learned to code in a hard way. It was my sophomore year in college. I was introduced to web programming, precisely HTML and CSS. I could barely follow class speed, and everything professor taught in class was like some irrelevant information, it got into my head, but not my brain.

When I started to learn JavaScript, it was worse. I didn't understand anything, literally anything. No matter how long I spent, no matter how many times I translated study material into my native language, I just couldn't wrap my head around of those programming terms. I read books without any comprehension.

I have never been one of those smart students in class, and I probably will never be. But, that's okay. To make things happen, I don't have to be super smart or talented as long as I work hard and willing to improve. There are millions of code snippets out there I can grab if I can't write my own,  at least I know that I can manipulate them to the way I need. If one code snippet doesn't work, I will try a different one until I find the one it does. I believe as time goes, I am going to be
good at what I am doing, all I need is persistence.

People tend to say no to new things. It is a Human Nature. You feel vulnerable when you learn, nobody likes that feeling. However, look at the bright side, whenever you are feeling vulnerable, it means you are learning, feeling weak is just the first step of becoming better. The thing is you have to believe in yourself and invest yourself. People often say that if you don't even believe in yourself, why should anyone else?

Last but not least, I'd like to quote from Master Oogway:

> Don't be too concerned with what was and what will be. There's a saying, yesterday is a history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift, that is why it's called present.
