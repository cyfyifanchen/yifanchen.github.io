## Why use vim

Don't try to fit in. One day, it will occur to us life is much more rewarding when choose the rode not taken, a life not patterned after
someone else's, the editor, only you know how to use.

I like vim, tmux and zsh. I spend a lot of time to config, maintain and perfect my dotfiles. Knowing vim makes coding productive and enjoyable.
I don't buy the shit when people say, oh coding is 90% thinking and 10% writing. I spend 90% of my time fix code rather than writing code, when I 
want to reach the specific part of a file, I want it happen as quick as possible. To me, vim is a state of art, quickly navigating through lines of code,
creatively combining shortcuts, endlessly learning mind blowing tricks, all of these make vim irresistible to me.

Vim has massive shortcuts, there is always a better way of doing same thing with less keystrokes. Additionally, vim brings me creative thinking. 
I wrote both [OSX-shortcuts-you-might-not-know](http://www.cyfyifanchen.com/osx-shortcuts/) and
[advanced-keymapping](http://www.cyfyifanchen.com/advanced-keymapping/) after I got additced to vim shortcuts.

After all, vim may not necessarily makes me a good developer, but definitely makes me a motivated developer.
