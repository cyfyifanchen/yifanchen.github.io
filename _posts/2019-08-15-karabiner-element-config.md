<span class="fl">K</span>eyboad Mastro was what I was using for a couple of years, it did the job while Karabiner wasn't able to keep up with macOS updates. I liked it and felt quite comfortable with tons cofigs, but I was not a fan of paying it annually. I ended up switching back to Karabiner, and this post is going to share how my setup is, maybe you find it helpful.
