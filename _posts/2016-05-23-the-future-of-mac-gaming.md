### Mac gaming is coming

For years, Mac gaming has only been a concept. With very limited development progress of OpenGL, Apple indeed needs its graphic technology to move away from OpenGL madness. <a href="https://developer.apple.com/metal/" target="_blank">Metal</a>, Appleâ€™s graphic technology, was created to solve the problem. It reduces layers between graphic card and graphic APIs, providing developers a rich environment to work with. Performance wise, Apple promises that Metal can improve more than 50%. Now, Metal has been adopted widely on iOS for two years, and the result is satisfactory.

At <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_p8AsQhaVKI">WWDC 2015</a>, Apple announced that Metal is coming to El Captian. At the same time, Blizzard officially commented that Metal is already working internally on *World of Warcraft*. Furthermore, it will be released by the end of the year. On top of this, *Starcraft 2* and *Heros of the storm* are expected to follow shortly after.

Metal, as a graphic API may not be able to revolutionize gaming on OSX. However, it cuts off the gap between Mac gaming and PC gaming significantly. Experiencing the same or better gaming experience on Mac just as on PC is not far anymore.


Reference: Here is a pretty good article I found, it talks about graphic APIs in depth:
