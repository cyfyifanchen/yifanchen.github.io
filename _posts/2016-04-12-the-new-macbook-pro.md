### Let's talk about the upcoming Macbook Pro

Still 2 months left for WWDC 2016. I am getting very impatient. I can't wait to see the new Macbook Pro. I am a laptop person who can live without a Phone, but not a laptop. With that being said, I also have some inputs for the highly anticipated laptop.

**Apperance**: It needs to be smaller, lighter and thinner. 

**Dispaly**: Don't need to worry about this. Apple always has the best display. I don't think there will be battery improvements since it's getting smaller, thinner and lighter. 

**Ports**: It's the future of laptop. USB Type-C is the future of connection. Seriously, people needs to stop complaining the lack of ports. Technology is moving forward, we can't always stick with a laptop that has freaking 5 USB ports.

**Keyboard**: Lots people don't like the new butterfly mechanism keyboard, I might be on the same boat. I own a blue switch mechanical keyboard, imagine how hard for me to like a keyboard that has almost zero travel. Hopefully, it doesn't take long for me to get used to it.

**Trackpad**: I can't complain Apple's trackpad at all ever since I started to use it. Altho today, there is still no Windows laptop has a trackpad that can even compare to Apple's trackpad.

**Memory**: Historically, Apple hasn't been generous to memory at all, which is something developers complain quite often. With memory intense applications like Chrome or Virtual Machine. 32GB is a must option for professional. I don't buy Apple's excuses when they say they care UX more than anything. That's kinda BS on MPB because MBPs are made for professionals.

**Gaming and Graphics**: Yes, you can always buy a cheaper Windows machine that runs games better. The truth is that both developers and game makers think Mac Gaming is a joke. With very limited market need, lack of developers, insufficient recourse made Mac Gaming how it is today. But like it or not, it might not be a joke for long. Apple announced its own graphic technology, Metal, at WWDC 2014. It has been widely adopted by developers on iOS. The result is amazing. Same time, Apple planned to implement Metal to OSX as well. I can't say that Mac Gaming will become a thing and potentially replace PC Gaming. But, in a tech world, anything is a possibility.

*Our version for personal computing has always been that the most powerful technology should deliver incredible capability without the complexity.* The boundary of software and hardware is zero to Apple, it is also what driving Apple to make technology powerful and yet reachable. With it's ecosystem, stunning industrial design and unlimited innovation, I can't wait to see the new MacBook Pro.
