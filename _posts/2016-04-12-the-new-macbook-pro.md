## What to expect for next gen of Macbook Pro

I have been looking forward to see the new sepcs of MacBook Pro ever since I bought my first Apple device back to the Summer of 2012. It was a MacBook Air, then I exchanged it to the new Macbook Pro one week later after Apple announced it at 2012 WWDC. Loved it afterwards.

### Performance

I bought my first Macbook Pro back in 2012 summer right after Apple announced it at WWDC 2012. It's called MacBook Pro with Retina Display. Price was high especially when I was in college, but I couldn't be happier for the result. I replaced it with my 2 months old ThinkPad W series. It was best decision ever. 

The current generation of Macbook Pro has always been rated one of the best laptops to buy through the years. Despite the slightly high price, it is extremely popular among developers. It's descripted as one the best laptop to won for developers.(Mostly Unix-based OS), .net developers,  I of the best laptops to buy since the day it was announced. that year, and of course, developers love this machine.Ever since after that, I got even more excited to see what the next generation of Retina
Macbook Pro is going to be like

This is what Apple thinks personal computing should be.
