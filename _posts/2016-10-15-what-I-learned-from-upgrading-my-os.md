I upgraded my work machine,  a 2013 MacBook Pro, to Sierra Thursday morning. I did use Time Machine to back up my files in case upgrading went wrong. Sierra was beautiful at the beginning of the day. Altho I didn't care Siri at all, but I enjoyed the new OS in general, especially the new Storage Mangement feature, which I thought Apple should have done it a while ago. Now, I no longer need third party application to optimize my space. However, I ended up not liking Sierra by the end of the day.

I like to upgrade my applications right away when there are updates. Probably because I am a developer, to me an update isn't a patch, it's a product of an iteration and a result of teamwork. However, when it comes to my work machine, I had to be careful.  I had many customizations added to my work machine this year. On top of that, I am Tmux and Vim user, and that means they aren't quite compatible with the new update in the beginning. With all these in my mind, I didn't update right away. I waited a couple of weeks after release, I consulted with some of my co-workers who did upgrade. Everything seemed working fine. Some of their machines are highly customized as well, which made me feel comfortable to upgrade. So, I did it on Thursday morning.

The first bug I noted was Karabiner, a must have keybinding tool for my workflow, didn't work at all. I went to their Github repo trying to find answers, realized there were serval Issues have been in the Open Stage for days. Then I saw my iTerm had this weird tiny space around it when I maximized the window, which bugged the crap out of me. Additionally, Dota2 had a serious mouse delay when moving the cursor to the edge. I couldn't even enjoy the game. On top of that, there were some other smaller issues that I could barely tolerate. Therefore, I thought about going back to El Captian. It would fix all of the problems. Then, it got me thinking. If I refuse to adopt new things, choose going back. It is not what I wanted in the first place. I am going to stick with Sierra. I am going forward and not looking back. But what about the problems? Easy, finding ways to solve them. I am a developer, I do what I am good at, seeking solutions to the problems.

Whether you like it or not, technology is moving forward. Instead of staying in the same place and complaining, adopting is the key to existence.
