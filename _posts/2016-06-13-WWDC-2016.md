There are too many articles are talking about what you need to know from yesterday's Keynote. I am not going to summarize it again. I admitted that I wanted a new MBP more than anything. Believe me, I impatiently waited for the whole time for Tim Cook to say *One More Thing*, god damn it, it didn't happen. With a mindset like that, I still liked Keynote, because it meant a brand new chapter to both consumers and developers.

Apple indeed comprised its ego, opened SDKs of its key applications to developers on four platforms. It grants advanced authorities to developers to build applications in a much more flexible way. In another word, Apple no longer asks developers to create what Apple wants. Instead, developers can be a lot more creative with what they want and what people wants. With the significant upcoming changes on iOS 10, apparently, Apple compromises to a fact of what people wants. It's opposed to Jobs' famous quote *A lot of times, people don't know what they want until you show it to them*.

Therefore, I liked the Keynote. I am excited to see how Apple's products will turn out after its compromise.
