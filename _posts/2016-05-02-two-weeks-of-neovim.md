## Two weeks down for Neovim

I wrote a post of switching to <a href="http://www.cyfyifanchen.com/first-day-of-neovim/" target="_blank">Neovim</a> a couple of weeks ago. It was a wise choice. I like everything about Neovim, not even one thing I want to complain about. I have seen people run into bugs here and there, luckily I haven't had any bugs. And the speed of Neovim is the biggest reward to me.

For those who are currently struggling speed of MacVim or Gvim, I would strongly suggest you consider switching. Neovim is newer with a lot less lines of code to maintain. For developers who switched, feedbacks are all positive.

Here is my <a href="https://github.com/yifanchen/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc" target="_blank">`.vimrc`</a>, all the plugs and settings are compatible with Neovim. Use it as a reference if you are considering switch.
