## Two weeks down for Neovim

I wrote a post about switching to <a href="http://www.cyfyifanchen.com/first-day-of-neovim/" target="_blank">Neovim</a> a couple of weeks ago. Now, I am writing another post confirming it was a wise choice. Unlike others, I haven't felt buggy at all in my two weeks of full time use. In return, the speed of Neovim is the best reward to me.

For those who are currently struggling speed of MacVim or Gvim, I would strongly suggest you consider switching. Neovim is newer with a lot less lines of code to maintain. For developers who switched, feedbacks are all positive.

Here is my <a href="https://github.com/yifanchen/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc" target="_blank">`.vimrc`</a>, all the Plugins and settings are compatible with Neovim. Use it as a reference if you are considering switch.
