## Learn From Code refactoring

I spent a few of hours refactoring the code on a simple page the other day. It occurs to me a new way of learning. As I was going through each line of the code, I started thinking that can this line of code be written in a better way? To be able to do this, I need to define the better way first. In general, there is no correct answer of writing code in a better or correct way. It comes down to the team effort.

First of first, following the best practices and code consistency of the team. Second, think and google a lot. Third, read through the documentation again(I found this is extremely helpful). In reality, as developers, we arenâ€™t granted enough time to think before we write. Code refactoring is an amazing chance to pick up that thought.

Treating code refactoring as a new way to learn, a new way to discover, getting out of the comfort zone, trying to code in a different aspect. This is a great way to get better, more importantly, you will be enjoying code refactoring.
