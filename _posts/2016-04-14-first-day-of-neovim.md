## First day of using Neovim

As my [`.vimrc`](https://github.com/yifanchen/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc) gets complicated, Vim can get slow often, I had to take off some great features to maintain the sweet speed. I started to use code checkers and linters recently, fond out Vim gets even slower when opening big `.js` files with code style checkers on. That's probably the biggest problem the current version of Vim has, it doesn't work asynchronously. In another word, Vim freezes when the former action being
executed.

Neovim is very new, in fact the beta version is still not released. But, I've heard good things from other Vimmers, especially how faster it is comparing with Vim. Vim's speed doesn't bother me much before, but it has started lately. Neovim has the asynchronous process, super sweet. Today is my fist day of using it. I like how fast it is. I will write another blog post after couple weeks.
