<span class="fl">I</span> can’t believe that Google's Inbox is going away. As usual, I went to Inbox to browse my emails this morning, shockingly saw a popup saying that Google is shutting down Inbox by March 2019, and they encourage Inbox users to use Gmail instead. Although Google claims Gmail already has Inbox features implemented and people adopted them very well, I still think Inbox is way more personal. 

Almost exactly four years ago, Google launched Inbox, a new way of emailing. The entire purpose of Inbox is offering a clean and neat UI that allows users to get rid of cluttered emails and keep inbox empty. Not only the UI was well done, but the UX was also great, it presented a concept of showing people archiving read emails. This feature took a hit at the time because people were not used to seeing their inboxs empty. For me, I liked it and adopted it quickly. I loved to see  'a sun floating in the middle of my screen', on a concept level, to-dos completed. 

So what happened? Why is Google taking away the Inbox? Well, that I don’t know, but subtle clues, along the way, hinted the decision today. First of all, Google never updated UI of Inbox since it was launched. Secondly, it took up to a year to patch the design issue on Inbox's iOS app. Last but not least, the search functionality is not even a fraction of Google's Search.

Realistically, a product itself doesn’t present a value, people who use it does.  In other words, if the cost of maintaining a product is too high, and the value is too low, then the product shouldn't be maintained. 

I shrugged my shoulder, thinking ‘maybe it was not as good as I thought it would be’. I then moved my mouse cursor to the Applications Folder, dragged an icon, that was strange yet familiar, to the Dock.

It was Mail.
