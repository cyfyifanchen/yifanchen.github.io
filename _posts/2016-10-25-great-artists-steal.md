Well, Xiaomi accnoneced the concept phone which is edgeless phoen today at Beijing, it's called MIX. The phone itself is absolutely georges.


What is the pattern? It is what you think is the best might not be the best within 5 yaers. What do you do then? You adopt.

For those of you who don't even understand technology and products, stopping making some comments, by all that means, you are only making yourself dumber.

This phone is absolutely stunning, it is the best looking the most beautiflu phone ever since iPhone 4.

I read tech news on mutiple sourcs including mashbale.com, hackernews and techcruch.com.
