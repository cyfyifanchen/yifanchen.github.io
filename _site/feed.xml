<content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:3000/thoughts-of-three-days-conference/">&lt;p&gt;I spent three days in downtown San Francisco for ForwardJS Conference this week. It has been fun, attending the conference is the purpose of the trip. Immersing in the city is a bonus to the plan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have been in southern California many times, but San Francisco was my first stop in the north. The weather gets chilly in the mornings and nights. Some areas can be foggy at sunset. Daytime temperature is a lot warmer than mornings and nights, so better have a jacket handy. If I don’t happen to be a summer animal, I would like the weather more. I was glad I checked the weather before, so I took a jacket with me, it was not useless at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, workshops can be ruined by not prepare materials before. The intentions of attending workshops are getting trained for certain things you don’t know, or you barely know. We are developers, so obviously, we don’t want to come out with a “Hello, World!” application after training. But, workshop goes faster, the best way to get the most out of it is knowing the content. For the best, build something before you go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another way to ruin workshops is from instructors. Having few hours long presentations regarding history, benefits and future of the content. That is wrong. I am not saying that I don’t value any of that. But, it’s a workshop, hands down and builds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In conclusion,  not every workshop is worth the energy to go. For those of you who thinks one workshop can get you up to speed, you are wrong. You might be bale to build something, but won’t be able to understand everything. To master something, it takes serious dedication and motivation.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Thoughts of Using Vim</title>

<id>http://localhost:3000/thoughts-of-using-vim</id>
<content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:3000/thoughts-of-using-vim/">&lt;p&gt;I installed &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/jceb/vim-orgmode&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vim-orgmode&lt;/a&gt; to my Vim yesterday. For those of you, who haven’t heard Org-mode, it is an editing and organizing mode for notes, planning, and authoring in Emacs. It is a must have for all Emacs users. I strongly recommend you to watch &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oJTwQvgfgMM&quot;&gt;this video&lt;/a&gt; on youtube. It will mostly likely change your view of how powerful something can be. Due to Org-mode’s popularity, someone awesome created a orgmode for vim on Github. I found it and installed it. Thanks for the open source community, life is beautiful because of you. I like Vim as a text editor, like Emacs as an environment(no offense to Emacs users, I honestly think Emacs is too powerful to be a text editor).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took a little time go through my &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/yifanchen/dotfiles/blob/master/.vimrc&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;.vimrc&lt;/a&gt; file after I committed the change to Github, it then occurred to me that Vim has been so much fun to use for the past eight months. And, learning Vim has been a tremendous investment to me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have always preferred videos when it comes to learning. Having some kinds of visual presentations can get me through the points a lot easier. So, Youtube is my best friend. But, there weren’t many Vim tutorials on Youtube. I had to find other ways to learn. Lots people write blogs of their dotfiles. Those were helpful If I only wanted their Vim settings. Vim wiki is a good place to go, but too dry to read. I didn’t have many options left, but being patient, learning it slowly. I ended up spending weeks figuring out every piece of vimscript that I need. I tried to make Vim behave like a regular IDE. I had easy options like using Vim GUI or installing Vim emulators in standard text editors. I tried vim-mode package in Atom, and it was flawless. However, I wasn’t too satisfied with it. I didn’t quite like running both Atom and iTerm while doing development. I distinctly remember I talked myself out of using Atom with vim-mode not one time, not twice, but multiple times just because the nerdy soul in me didn’t allow me to go with the simple choice. You know, sometimes being stubborn is a double edge, I guess in my case, at least this time it was on the right side. I made it happen, the UI, the speed, and the capabilities of my Vim are not as same as a standard editor, but unique and better.&lt;/p&gt;

<title>Today is a Present</title>
<link href="http://localhost:3000/today-is-present/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Today is a Present" />

<id>http://localhost:3000/today-is-present</id>
<content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:3000/today-is-present/">&lt;p&gt;I recently gave a short talk to few iOS development students who are currently in Code Camp busting their asses to finish projects. I am very proud of them. Decisions were not easy to make when they wanted to change careers, especially when some of them have families. Most students ditched their no-future careers, then entirely dedicated to intensive Code Camp courses, hopefully, coming out with great skill sets to find jobs that they like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard that a lot of people say coding is easier than it looks, I disagree, coding is not easy at all, in fact, it is hard from lots different aspects. I learned to code in a hard way. It was my sophomore year in college. I was introduced to web programming, precisely HTML and CSS. I could barely follow class speed, and everything professor taught in class was like some irrelevant information, it got into my head, but not my brain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I started to learn JavaScript, it was worse. I didn’t’ understand anything, literally anything. No matter how long I spent, no matter how many times I translated study material into my native language, I just couldn’t wrap my head around of those programming terms. I read books without any comprehension.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have never been one of those smart students in class, and I probably will never be. But, that’s okay. To make things happen, I don’t have to be super smart or talented as long as I work hard and willing to improve. There are millions of code snippets out there I can grab if I can’t write my own,  at least I know that I can manipulate them to the way I need. If one code snippet doesn’t work, I will try a different one until I find the one it does. I believe as time goes, I am going to be
good at what I am doing, all I need is persistence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People tend to say no to new things. It is a Human Nature. You feel vulnerable when you learn, nobody likes that feeling. However, look at the bright side, whenever you are feeling vulnerable, it means you are learning, feeling weak is just the first step of becoming better. The thing is you have to believe in yourself and invest yourself. People often say that if you don’t even believe in yourself, why should anyone else?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the end, to make this blog post wise. I’d like to quote from Master Oogway, &lt;em&gt;Don’t be too concerned with what was and what will be. There’s a saying, yesterday is a history, tomorrow is a mystery, today is a gift, that is why it’s called present.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

<title>不变的范特西</title>

<content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:3000/still-fantasy/">&lt;p&gt;印象里，我只花过一次钱买歌曲专辑 。12岁那年，我在购书。店里的背景音乐是《爱在西元前》，我当时觉得歌曲节奏轻快，旋律性强，歌词虽听不太清，但不影响我对歌曲的喜爱，于是买了一盘《范特西》回家，那是我第一次花钱买歌曲专辑。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;一年之后，当西方人民都在恐慌五角大楼打飞机的同时，地球的另一端，我哼着《双截棍》顺利考入城内一所二流初中。家长和老师眼里除了读书还是读书的学生生活单调到不行，好像所有的课余生活就剩听歌，大街小巷的《东风破》，仿佛世界都在放中国风。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;步入高中，我对学习彻底失去了兴趣，辗转几个学校也没起到任何作用。父母郁闷的同时，无知的我天天在听《七里香》，17岁的夏天，美好到不行，满怀期待自己初恋的到来。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;穿越太平洋，美利坚不相信眼泪。语言的不同和文化的差异对一个不经世事的19岁少年来说相当残酷。伴随的，依旧是音乐，对家的思念让我爱上《听妈妈的话》。努力天天向上的同时，《一路向北》支持着我前进。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;上班之后，在线音乐服务是主流，世界级的音乐可供选择时候，不变的是那个叫“范特西” 的播放目录，里面的歌曲只加不减。&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;犹记那年，我买了一盘叫《范特西》的磁带回家，那是我最后一次花钱买歌曲专辑，拉开的，是丰富的人生序幕。&lt;/p&gt;
