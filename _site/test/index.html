<p>Beautiful, I finally figured out something has been bugging me for so long. So here you go, I want to share it with you today.</p>

<p>Vim is acronym of “Vi Improved” is a clone of Bill Joy’s vi text editor program for unix. We all know that Vi was born in 1988, and the better version of Vi, Vim was released publicly in 1991.</p>

<p>Therefore, I’ve always wanted to make my text editor beautiful and awesome.</p>

<p>Therefore, I go to <a href="http://vimcolors.com/">Vim Color</a> often to checkout the latest color.</p>

<p>Getting the color scheme to look right in Vim is notoriously cumbersome, I heard my asccsiontates complained why there is no color looks right as <a href="http://vimcolors.com/">Vim Color</a> shows. He was right because Vim doesn’t understand the color setting, you have to set it right in a hard way.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>let $NVIM_TUI_ENABLE_TRUE_COLOR=1

set -g default-terminal "xterm-256color"
set-option -ga terminal-overrides ",xterm-256color:Tc"

tmux -V

brew upgrade tmux
</code></pre>
</div>
